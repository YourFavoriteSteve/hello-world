# hello-world
My first github repository.
I'm a programmer--started with Batch files when I was a kid, did HTML, then Flash animations with ActionScript, then CSS, and then Javascript. In my career, I learned C# and Visual Basic in the .NET Visual Studio IDE by programming solutions for the jobs I held. I of course did plenty of VBA macros in Excel. In college, I studied SQL, ASP.NET, Java, C#, and Visual Basic.
